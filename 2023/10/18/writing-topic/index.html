We can gather information about the time of construction, the builders, the location, and the local history, among other things. The time of construction often has reasons and purposes behind it. By researching the builders, we can understand the kind of people they were. The location of a building can provide insights into why it was erected. Exploring the local history helps us understand the significance of buildings for the local people.
