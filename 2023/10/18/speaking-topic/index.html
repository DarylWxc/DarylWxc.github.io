<h1 id="Education"><a href="#Education" class="headerlink" title="Education"></a>Education</h1><h1 id="Career"><a href="#Career" class="headerlink" title="Career"></a>Career</h1><h1 id="Occupation"><a href="#Occupation" class="headerlink" title="Occupation"></a>Occupation</h1><p>My Occupation is web developer.It’s the IT(Information Technology) industry.<br>The job is about coding the web page.We take design drawing and we achieve it.<br>We will talk to the back end and designer for better experience of Customers.<br>We care about the efficiency and functions of the web page.It is not easy for us to learn improving efficiency of system.We request the data and draw it on the web page.It just like you are one creater and you are creating your masterpiece.That’s awesome.we always feel satisfied about the prosess.And the salary is not bad too.Actually i was raised in China,we all accepted the exam oriented education.It cause that we don’t know what we want and we real love to do after graduation.We just choose the industry we really familiar to.</p>
<h1 id="Hobby"><a href="#Hobby" class="headerlink" title="Hobby"></a>Hobby</h1><p>My hobby is Music and Games.My life can’t without the Music.I listen to several styles of Music.The melodic progressive house is my favorite.I just enjoy the melody.And BPM(Beat Per Minute) of that style is about 120 to 130.</p>
<h1 id="Hometown"><a href="#Hometown" class="headerlink" title="Hometown"></a>Hometown</h1><ul>
<li>Where are you from?<br>I am from FuJian province,QuanZhou City.It’s a southeast city of China and opposite to TaiWan.In my views,that’s a beautiful city which worth you to travel here.</li>
<li>How long have you been living there?<br>I have been living here beforn i went to university.I spend my childhood in this city.</li>
<li>Is your hometown a big city or a small city?<br>My hometown is just a small city.It don’t have enough population just like the other big cities,and Of course its economic.</li>
<li>Do you like your hometown?<br>There is no doubt that i like my born place.I have friends and parents here.Besides,i like its climate and culture.People live here don’t need to speed up(accelerate) their pace of life.Work life balance is the best choice for me.</li>
<li>Are there anything you dislike about your hometown?<br>On the one hand,it’s difficult for you to be employed(get a job) here,you need to learn<br>skills that are suitable for the needs of others.On the other hand,the cost of life is not low here.Perhaps you will worry about the expenses of food and accomodation.</li>
<li>Has your hometown changed over the years?What are the changes?<br>Actually,i don’t find many changes here.A lot taller and modern buildings are erected.And the transportation is more convenient than past.The high speed railway develops rapidly.That’s all i think about.</li>
<li>Do you think you will continue living there for a long time?<br>It’s my pleasure to live here.But if i have the opportunity to live in another city,i think i will move to there for working and strive to my career.I don’t want to limit myself in just one city.I want to exprience different lifestyles in this world.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Work-or-Study"><a href="#Work-or-Study" class="headerlink" title="Work or Study"></a>Work or Study</h1><ul>
<li>Are you a student or are you working right now?<br>I have graduated for over three years.So,definitely,I am working now.</li>
<li>Do you like your job?<br>My job is web developer,my duty is to design and code the webpages,it feels like you are creating something that is useful and beautiful for users.That’s amazing,so i choose that work and satisfied with it.</li>
<li>What do you find most interesting about your work&#x2F;job?<br>You know,when we are coding,we usually need to adjust elements of webpages and decide what color,size,font to use.It just like sulpturing,every steps you have done make your masterpiece more perfect.It make sense to me.That’s my favorite part.</li>
<li>What is the most important quality of a co-worker&#x2F;colleague?<br>I think the spirit of cooperation is the most significant.If you and your workmates don’t aim to the same goal and stick together,it is hard for a team to give out the result that is valuable and satisfactory.That’s lethal for a group.</li>
<li>Which matters to you more,the job itself or the people you work with?<br>Acutally it is hard for me to set the level with that.They are all important to me,the awlful work or terrible colleagues both make me feel bad.And i believe that will influence my work status for a whole day.</li>
<li>Have you ever changed your work before?<br>No,i have never chanaged my job.For me,i think i still have a long way to go and i need to improve my work skills.In my mind,it’s not the good choice to change the job frequently.If you don’t spend enough time and keep on what you do,you are hardly successful with anything.</li>
<li>Do you think you will change your job in the future?<br>I think i might change my job later.You know,people’s mind changing all the time that my thoughts too.Perhaps when i arrived my thirties,i will have different decisions and change my lifestyle.And i believe i won’t be work like now at that time.</li>
<li>What was your first day at work like?<br>I will never forget the first day i went to work.Obviously,i felt nervous and shy.And we usually don’t need to do the real work in the beginning.Cuz you need to trained and ready for your job.And i spend some time on getting familiar with the people and facilites around me.And my colleagues helped me a lot,i was grateful to them.</li>
<li>What do you want your company to improve?<br>In my opinion,the time arrangement perhaps need to be more flexible.People nowadays have lots of personal things to do.If we  have enough for solving the problem of life and get nice work status,It will be a good news for everyone.In addition,some limitations and rules should be also set for it,the boundary must be reasonable.</li>
<li>What kind of jobs are popular in China?<br>As i know,people like doctor,teacher and agent would be more popular.Cuz we always think they look decent.Most of us want to have a stable job like that,if you have it,you will even praised a lot from your family and neighors.</li>
<li>Would you like to go to another country to work?<br>Sure thing.If i have a chance,i will.The world is so big for me,and i don’t want to be limited in just one country.There are lots of things that i want to explore and experience.Life is just once,don’t waste your time and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Home-Accommodation"><a href="#Home-Accommodation" class="headerlink" title="Home &amp; Accommodation"></a>Home &amp; Accommodation</h1><ul>
<li>Do you live in an apartment or house?<br>I have been living in a house which is self build by my parents for over 18 years.After i graduated from university,i usually live in the apartment near the downtown.</li>
<li>Do you like your apartment or house?<br>Actually,i enjoy living in house.I think the enough space is the most significant factor that will influence your life quality heavily.On the other hand,we usually don’t need to worry about noise from upstairs or downstairs.And you often live with your intimate persons in a house,that’s good for you.</li>
<li>What is your house or apartment like?<br>It is next to another house and built traditionally,i think it look like a square box.It’s not that pretty on the outside.But it make you feel warm when you get inside.The importance is who you live with,and my family is in it.</li>
<li>What views can you see through the windows?<br>The house is nearby a mountain that is regarded as a scenic area.When you look outside the window and we will catch the trees,mountain and waterfall,birds perhaps.Sometimes you will see some tourists walking on the road and ready for climbing.</li>
<li>What kind of apartment or house do you want to have in the future?<br>In my view,the house don’t need to be too big,enough is just ok.The most important factor is who you live with.I want to have a house with second floor and my family is all here.When i finish my daily work,i back home and get into it,then i feel relax and pleased.Cuz i know,that’s my home.</li>
<li>Which part of your country are you from?<br>I am from FuJian Province,QuanZhou City.It is oppsite to TaiWan.In the southeast of China.</li>
<li>Are you proud of your home country?<br>Well,to be honest,i’m not that pround of this country.China is a developing country and still has a long way to go.And the quality of education,food security and health care should be improve as soon as possible.But there are still some advantages here.The transportation and logistics are growing rapidly and already got a better achievement.</li>
<li>Can you recommend a place which is suitable for living?<br>If you ask me,i would like to recommand my hometown.Even if it is not a big city and transpotation is not that good.but here you can enjoy the great food and choose what lifestyle you want.People are friendly and willing to help each other.And it has various cultures and religions,you don’t have to worry about fitting in.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="The-area-you-live-in"><a href="#The-area-you-live-in" class="headerlink" title="The area you live in"></a>The area you live in</h1><ul>
<li>Do you like the area that you live in?<br>That’s a good question.To be honest,i’m not really like this area i living in.The noise everywhere and the cost of living are extremely high.Even if the city is the center of FuJian province.Another factor,i don’t like the customs,it is hard for me to get used to it.Just like now,i start to recall the good food of my hometown already.</li>
<li>What are some changes in the area recently?<br>If you ask me,i haven’t seen some changes in the area.Perhaps i rarely went outside recently.Accroding to my view,everyday is almost the same to me.The residents,transpotation,buildings etc.So,you know.</li>
<li>Do you know any famous people in your area?<br>Well,to the best of my knowledge.I only know one which is famous for her poet and her name is HuiYin Lin.Her poem even appeared in our textbooks.As i recall,when i was in elementary school,i have ever read and leant about her poem that made me impressive.She was a talented person.</li>
<li>Where do you like to go in that area?<br>If there is a place of this area i most like to go,it must be our home chruch.Well,i am a Christian.I enjoy staying with my siblings.They are all kind with each other.I can share my feelings and experiences to them which always make me relax and release.Sometimes you are under stress and pain,then you come,and you probably be cured by the words of others.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Transport"><a href="#Transport" class="headerlink" title="Transport"></a>Transport</h1><ul>
<li>How do you go to work&#x2F;school?<br>Cuz i am close to my company which is less than one kilometer,i walk to work.If sometimes i need to go outside that is far away for me.I will take the bus or subway.That’s more convenient and affordable for me.Even if i have a drive license,i don’t have a car.</li>
<li>What’s the most popular meas of transpotation in your hometown?<br>Actually the transpotation of my hometown is not that convenient.There is no subway.We often go out by electric bike or bus.We don’t really like driving,it’s easy to get stuck in traffic.</li>
<li>How far is it from your home to work&#x2F;school?<br>It’s not so far.Just less than one kilometer.Go outside the community and walk up a short distance.right over there.</li>
<li>Do you think people will drive more in the future?<br>No,i don’t think so.Except the aviation,AI is develping faster and faster,just like automatic driving technique of Tesla,there will be more tech like this.Eventually,people will get used to driveless vehicles and free their hands.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Chatting"><a href="#Chatting" class="headerlink" title="Chatting"></a>Chatting</h1><ul>
<li>Do you like chatting with friends?<br>Sure thing.Talk to my friends is one of the way of entertainments.Most of us like to share our exprience and feelings to intimate people.It will release your stress and encourage you a lot.We usually have a good conversation with each other.</li>
<li>What do you usually chat about with friends?<br>Well,it depends on who you talk with.If you are chat with friends that you often play with,then you must have a topic about games.Or you have a meet with the friends of chruch,you will talk about religion.</li>
<li>Do you prefer to chat with a group of people or with only one friend?<br>That’s a good question.We all have our secret and we don’t want to say that when have a chat with a group.But if we talk to our friends one by one.It’s easier for us to say what we’re hiding.So i like to chat with only one person instead of one group.</li>
<li>Do you prefer to communicate face-to-face or via social media?<br>For me,i would like to share myself face to face.Cuz we can have an interaction and watch what emotions another one have and figure out his or her feelings.It’s a sign that help you with what you should talk about or avoid conflict with others.</li>
<li>Do you argue with friends?<br>Yes.When we have different ideas.It definitely will cause an argument if they know.But i rarely say those out,i don’t want to break our relationship.Excpet they really need my help and i want to.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Musical-instrument"><a href="#Musical-instrument" class="headerlink" title="Musical instrument"></a>Musical instrument</h1><ul>
<li>Have you ever learned to play a musical instrument?<br>When i was in my university,i tried to learn about playing piano.But i found that i don’t have so much time for practice,i gave up eventually.That’s a shame.I always think play a musical instrument is really cool.</li>
<li>What musical instrument do you enjoy listening to the most?<br>In my opinion,playing the piano is very elegant,it just like your fingers are dancing,and the great music reply to your dance.I usually love to listen piano performance in a quiet environment which make me relax and enjoy.</li>
<li>Do you think children should learn to play an instrument at school?<br>Well,if they want,is should be a great and positive way for them to express their feelings and emothions.And the music often encourage people for sticking to their aims and dreams.It plays an important role in our life and worth us to learn with.</li>
<li>Do you think music education is important to children?<br>It must be.Music is another language in the world.We can communicate and make friends with others by the music.Actually if you know about and try to feel music,that will benefit your mental health.It’s not bad.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Films"><a href="#Films" class="headerlink" title="Films"></a>Films</h1><ul>
<li>What films do you like?<br>I used to watch cartoon when I was a child.After i grew up,i would like to watch science fiction film.I think this kind of movies could help you to expand your mind and open your thoughts.You can dream about a fantasic world around you and feel it.</li>
<li>Did you often watch films when you were a child?<br>Sure thing.Watching movies is one type of entertainment.I believe that playing is the character of all children.I was one of them.Every chance to see a movie is precious for me when i was young.So i always took the opportunity to have fun of it.</li>
<li>Did you ever go to the cinema alone as a child?<br>I often watched movie by computer.And well,you know.The main point is the content what you see.In addition,the film ticket is not cheap for me.So,Of course,i have never been to the cinema alone even if i grew up.</li>
<li>Do you often go to the cinema with your friends?<br>No.The internet developes rapidly.We don’t have to go to the cinema for a film.And,i don’t have too much time to stay with my friends.We all have our personal time.On the other hand,watching movies is not the prior form of entertainmant.</li>
<li>Do you think going to the cinema is a good way to spend time with friends?<br>If you ask me,i would say no.Even shopping is a better way to have fun with your friends than watching movies.but the best way is always the travel.We all have a dream about traveling around the world,right?The bad news is we don’t have enough money.That’s a pity.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Gifts"><a href="#Gifts" class="headerlink" title="Gifts"></a>Gifts</h1><ul>
<li>Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?<br>I definitely did. Date back to my childhood, that’s the birthday of my elder sister, I made some paper stars and put them into a bottle as a gift for her. I still remember her face full of happiness and I feel that too.</li>
<li>Have you ever received a great gift?<br>Personally, I don’t have too much chance to receive a gift. Therefore, every time the gift I get means that I am pretty happy. That’s a great gift. I’m concerned more about who blesses you.</li>
<li>What do you consider when choosing a gift?<br>Well, I will think about what another will need more. The most important point is the meaning of gifts which represent your heart. If you are intimate with him or her, you will focus on what he likes and wants.</li>
<li>Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?<br>Oh,absolutely not. I am not pretty romantic to choose the gifts that could catch one’s heart. It’s not what I am good at. Sometimes I would like to ask directly what others want. But that’s not a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Noise"><a href="#Noise" class="headerlink" title="Noise"></a>Noise</h1><ul>
<li>Do you like to stay in a place with a lot of noise?<br>In my opinion, I don’t believe anyone would choose to live in a noisy place, let alone like doing so. I can’t stand being exposed to noise for a long time, especially when studying. I think noise negatively impacts one’s emotions and ability to focus. That’s not my thing. Therefore, I always try my best to avoid it.</li>
<li>What kinds of noise are there in the area where you live?<br>Well, let me think about it. There are redecoration and ceremony noises that I have suffered. I especially hate the redecoration noise, every time I try to take a short snap, the noise starts. Sometimes the redecoration starts in the early mornings, and I consequently can’t sleep well.</li>
<li>Do you want to move to a quieter place?<br>I definitely want to, although the unfortunate reality is that I don’t have enough money to move somewhere quieter. Therefore, Even though I hate the noise, I have to bear it. However, I believe that one day I will significantly improve my current living conditions.</li>
<li>Do you think there is too much noise in today’s world?<br>I definitely think so. That’s why I often go outside with my headphones on. It doesn’t matter whether I’m commuting, shopping, studying, or just wandering, I just want to separate myself from the noise of the world. I don’t want to hear too many useless sounds.</li>
<li>Is making noise one of people’s right?<br>Personally, I believe people are entitled to make sounds if they need to. However, they should always be cautious of and consider others’ feelings, and give a warning if their sounds will disturb others. This demonstrates basic respect between people. We shouldn’t do anything that we want, especially if it could harm others.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Helping-others"><a href="#Helping-others" class="headerlink" title="Helping others"></a>Helping others</h1><ul>
<li>Do you usually help people around you?<br>Well, I don’t often help people around me, in our culture, we rarely seek help from others. but if I meet one person who calls for help and I can do that, I would like to give him or her a hand. Before I choose to help others, I have to make sure it won’t cause damage to me.</li>
<li>How do you usually help people around you,such as neighbours,family and friends?<br>When I was a child, I often be asked to do the housework for my family, it just took me a short time, and I usually accepted it. Sometimes my dad will let me help with him about operation of a smartphone which he doesn’t know a lot about but I am more familiar than him, so I do it.</li>
<li>Do your parents teach you help to help others?<br>In their minds, just like what I think, before you try to help others, you need to make sure it won’t let you get hurt, then you can help them. Well, they are my parents and care about my safety first. I understand that.</li>
<li>Did your parents help you a lot when you were young?<br> You know, in China, the dedication spirit of parents is more great than other relationships. They always try to give the best to their children. And my parents are the same kind of them, so they helped me a lot. I never doubt that.</li>
<li>What have you done to help the elderly?<br>The most common situation that happened to me was that I gave the elder a seat, another thing that I did was to lift the elder to walk for a short distance and avoid him from falling. To the best of my knowledge, that’s my help to the elder people.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Run"><a href="#Run" class="headerlink" title="Run"></a>Run</h1><ul>
<li>Do you go running a lot?<br>I went to sports ground running three times a week when I was in university. After I start working, I don’t have much free time for doing sports. Therefore, I’m not running frequently now. Sometimes I will go outside to wander after dinner.</li>
<li>Where do you usually go running?<br>Well, I will go to the sports ground and road behind the hill for running. I like to run on the track, I need to follow the direction of the runway and stick to it. It makes me feel like I’m in the right way.</li>
<li>When was the last time you went running?<br>I can’t remember it exactly. Perhaps when I was at home, I went to the track behind the hill and ran for more than 3 kilometers. I didn’t do sports for a long time at least half a year. I know that’s not good for my health. But I have too much to deal with.</li>
<li>What do you think of running as a sport?<br>Personally, I think it is a good sport for exercise that will benefit your body. I like to listen to music when I am running, it makes me feel relaxed. In my opinion, running is the most simple aerobic exercise for me. Therefore, I enjoy it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Map"><a href="#Map" class="headerlink" title="Map"></a>Map</h1><ul>
<li>Do you often use maps?<br>Well, I always use the maps when I go outside. I can’t remember all the streets or the roads I have been through before. Obviously, I need the maps to direct myself to which way is right for my destination.</li>
<li>Do you use paper maps?<br>No, I think the map apps will be more convenient than paper maps. I don’t want to carry the unnecessary paper outside. But if I have no choice, I will choose to use the paper maps that I need.</li>
<li>How often do you use maps on your phone?<br>It depends on where I wanna go, if I go to somewhere I am familiar with, I won’t use the maps. Cause I remembered the way I usually go. vice versa, when I need to go to places that I don’t know about, I will use the maps.</li>
<li>Do you have maps at home?<br>Of course I have, it is a world map hanging up on the wall but just for decoration now. When I was a child, I used that map to learn about geography knowledge and the positions of other countries. It can stand for one part of my childhood.</li>
</ul>
